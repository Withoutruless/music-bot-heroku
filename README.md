# Setup
Once you have created the app on Heroku, go into **Manage app > Settings > Config Vars** and add a configuration value called `base64_encoded_config`.

Then, take your [config.txt file for MusicBot](https://jmusicbot.com/setup#3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-edit-the-config-file) and [convert it to base64](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/file).

Paste the base64 value into the value box and save your changes. **Your bot should come online shortly after!**
